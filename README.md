# hello-world

Hello earthlings,

My name is Faith Kimetto. I have always wanted to learn how to code. I had this idea that code was extremely difficult. A terrible concoction of the most difficult mathematics, physics, statistics, physics and every other mind bending knowledge there was to learn. So I never tried. 

Thankfully I grew up developed an awareness that difficult doesnt mean impossible. So, here I am setting myself up against the goliath that is programming. I am determined to succeed and learn many things along the way. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Have a lovely day.
